## Data Processing and Visualization
- `Pandas` manages CSV operations with efficient data structures for manipulation and transformation.
- `Plotly` creates interactive charts and graphs, allowing users to visualize their data effectively.

## Task Automation and Tools
- `Django Cron` handles scheduled tasks, particularly the hourly CSV exports.
- Development tools like `Django Browser Reload` and `Django Compressor` optimize the development workflow and application performance.

## Additional Components
- `Django REST Framework`: For building RESTful APIs.
- `Django Unfold`: For a modern admin interface.
- `Git`: For version control and collaborative development.
