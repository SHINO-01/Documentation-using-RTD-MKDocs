# Project Goal

The `cron_project` aims to provide a comprehensive system for managing, processing, and visualizing transactional data. By combining manual data workflows with automated CRON processes, the system ensures real-time insights and scheduled processing, reducing manual intervention and improving data accuracy.

## Specific Objectives

1. **Automate Data Workflows:** Incorporate both manual and automated processes to streamline data import/export and transformation.
2. **Enhance Data Accuracy:** Validate and process transactional data to ensure reliability and consistency.
3. **Enable Real-Time Insights:** Visualize key performance metrics, such as revenue trends and geographical distributions, directly in the Django Admin interface.
4. **Automate Scheduled Processing:** Use a CRON process to handle daily data file updates independently of the database.
5. **Support Scalability and Flexibility:** Build a modular system that accommodates additional features and increased data volumes.
