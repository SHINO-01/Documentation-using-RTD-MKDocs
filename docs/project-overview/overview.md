# Project Overview

## KayakTransaction CSV Management System with Django Admin Integration
A `Django-based` data management system specifically designed to handle **KayakTransaction** CSV files. The system imports and processes these files, stores the data in a `PostgreSQL database`, and provides a `customized Django admin interface` for data visualization and management.

---

## Detailed Description

### Core Functionality
The system serves as a bridge between **KayakTransaction** CSV files and a `PostgreSQL database`, featuring a `custom Django admin panel` for visualizing and managing imported data.

---

### Key Components

#### Data Import System
The import system manages **KayakTransaction** CSV data ingestion through:

- A dedicated interface for uploading **KayakTransaction** CSV files.
- Comprehensive error handling during uploads.
- Intelligent parsing and validation specific to **KayakTransaction** data.
- Detailed validation reports to notify users of any issues with the data.

#### Custom Admin Interface
The Django admin panel is customized for **KayakTransaction** data, offering:

- Tailored views for displaying and navigating transaction data.
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities.
- Dynamic sorting for better data analysis and management.

#### Database Integration
PostgreSQL is configured to handle **KayakTransaction** data efficiently:

- Robust database schema designed for **KayakTransaction** CSV structures.
- Efficient query optimization for quick access to transaction data.
- Strong data integrity rules to ensure data consistency.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
The backend infrastructure consists of:

- `Django framework` for handling core application logic.
- `Django ORM` for managing database operations.
- Custom management commands for processing **KayakTransaction** CSV files.

### Database
PostgreSQL handles all data operations, including:

- Primary data storage optimized for **KayakTransaction** data.
- Strategic indexing for frequently queried fields.
- Strong data integrity and validation mechanisms.

### File Management
The system ensures proper handling of uploaded files:

- Organized storage for uploaded **KayakTransaction** CSV files.
- Automatic cleanup of outdated or invalid files to save space.
