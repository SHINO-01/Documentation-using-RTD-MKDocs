## Key Features and Constraints

### Primary Key:
- `id`: Serves as the primary key and is auto-incremented.

### Unique Constraint:
- `lead_id`: Ensures that no two transactions have the same lead identifier.

### Not Null Constraints:
- Core fields like `lead_date`, `lead_checkin`, `lead_checkout`, `revenue`, and `commission` are required.

### Nullable Fields:
- `hotel_country`, `hotel_city`, and `hotel_id` are optional, allowing for flexibility when location information is not available.

### Decimal Precision:
- Both `revenue` and `commission` are defined as `decimal(10,2)`, suitable for monetary values with two decimal places.
